# Enhanced Debug Logging - Mint Validation

## Updated Logging

Based on your logs showing account properties as `undefined`, the debug logging has been enhanced to:

### 1. Better Account Inspection
- Logs full response object to see actual structure from Gill RPC
- Checks if account info is null/undefined
- Extracts owner, lamports, and data separately

### 2. Mint Validation
- **Checks Owner**: Verifies account is owned by Token Program (`TokenkegQfeZyiNwAJbNbGKPFXCWuBvf9Ss623VQ5DA`)
- **Checks Data Length**: Mint accounts should be exactly 82 bytes
- **Provides Clear Error**: If validation fails, shows exactly what's wrong

### 3. Detailed Error Messages
Instead of generic "account not found", you'll now see:
```
The account either:
1. Does not exist
2. Is not owned by the Token Program
3. Is not a valid Mint account
```

## What to Look For in Logs

### Good Signs ✅
```
✅ USDC Mint Account Response:
  - Owner: TokenkegQfeZyiNwAJbNbGKPFXCWuBvf9Ss623VQ5DA
  - Lamports: [some number]
  - Data Type: ... Length: 82
  ✅ Account is owned by Token Program
  ✅ This appears to be a valid Mint account
```

### Problem Signs ❌
```
- Owner: undefined              → Account doesn't exist
- Owner: [different address]    → Wrong account type
- Data Length: [not 82]         → Not a Mint account
- Data Type: undefined          → Cannot read account data
```

## Most Important
Your logs showed:
- Account appears to be found
- But all properties undefined
- This suggests Gill's RPC is returning an object without the expected properties

The enhanced logging will now show the actual object structure so you can see what's being returned.

## Next Steps

1. **Run dev server**: `pnpm dev`
2. **Try to initialize fundraiser again**
3. **Check console for the mint validation logs**
4. **Look specifically for**:
   - `✅ Account is owned by Token Program` (good!)
   - Or owner/lamports/data values (to understand the structure)
5. **Share the logs if still failing**

The error "Attempt to load a program that does not exist" happens because the Anchor constraint `token::mint = usdc_mint` requires `usdc_mint` to be a valid, properly initialized Mint account owned by the Token Program. If that validation fails internally, Solana throws this error.
