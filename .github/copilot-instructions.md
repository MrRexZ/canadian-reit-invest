# GitHub Copilot Workspace Instructions for Canadian REIT Invest

## Project Overview
This repository implements a decentralized Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) platform on the Solana blockchain. Users can invest in USDC, which is converted to CAD off-chain and wired to Canadian REITs. Investors receive tokenized REIT shares and earn dividends proportional to their holdings. The platform uses Anchor for Solana programs, a React/Vite frontend for user interaction, and integrates with external services for currency conversion and dividend distribution.

Key features:
- Onchain investment tracking via PDAs (Program-Derived Addresses)
- Tokenized REIT shares with metadata
- Dividend payouts in USDC
- Admin controls for releases, minting, and refunds

## Architecture
- **Backend (Solana Programs)**: Written in Rust using Anchor framework. Located in `anchor/` directory. Includes programs for investment, token minting, and escrow management.
- **Frontend**: React application built with Vite, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Shadcn UI components. Located in `src/` directory. Handles user wallets, transactions, and UI components. Design theme must fit within the Shadcn framework.
- **Tests**: Unit tests for Solana programs in `tests/`, integration tests in `anchor/tests/`.
- **Configuration**: Anchor.toml for Solana deployment, package.json for frontend dependencies, tsconfig files for TypeScript.
- **External Integrations**: Notion API for documentation (via MCP server), external CAD conversion services (off-chain).

## Key Concepts
- **PDAs (Program-Derived Addresses)**: Used for state management (e.g., Investor State PDA tracks investments, Fundraiser PDA manages escrow).
- **Escrow Vault**: Holds USDC until released by admin for CAD conversion.
- **REIT Tokens**: SPL tokens representing shares, minted after successful CAD wiring.
- **Flows**:
  1. Invest: User sends USDC â†’ Investor State PDA created.
  2. Release: Admin releases USDC for off-chain CAD conversion.
  3. Mint: Admin mints REIT tokens to user.
  4. Dividends: Proportional USDC payouts based on holdings.
- **Off-chain Components**: CAD conversion and REIT wiring handled externally; confirmations trigger onchain actions.

## Coding Guidelines
- **Rust (Anchor)**: Follow Anchor best practices. Use PDAs for state, validate accounts strictly. Handle errors with custom error codes.
- **TypeScript/React**: Use functional components, hooks (e.g., useWallet from @solana/wallet-adapter). Ensure type safety with TypeScript. Use Shadcn UI components for consistent design and theming.
- **Security**: Validate all inputs, use proper authority checks. Avoid reentrancy in Solana programs.
- **Testing**: Write comprehensive tests for all onchain logic. Use Anchor's testing framework.
- **Dependencies**: Pin versions in package.json and Cargo.toml. Use audited crates.
- **Commits**: Use conventional commits (e.g., "feat: add investment PDA", "fix: handle refund logic").

## Common Patterns
- **PDA Derivation**: Use `find_program_address` with seeds like `b"investor_state"`, user pubkey, and investment ID.
- **Token Operations**: Use SPL token program for minting, transferring, and ATA (Associated Token Accounts) management.
- **Error Handling**: Define custom errors in Anchor programs (e.g., InsufficientFunds, InvalidAuthority).
- **Frontend Integration**: Use gill for transactions, @solana/wallet-adapter for wallet connections.

## File Structure Notes
- `anchor/programs/canadianreitinvest/src/lib.rs`: Main program logic.
- `src/features/`: Frontend features (account, cluster, dashboard).
- `src/components/`: Reusable UI components using Shadcn (wallet, modals, explorers).
- `tests/`: End-to-end tests for Solana programs.

## Additional Context
- **Deployment**: Use Anchor CLI for Solana deployment. Frontend deployed via Vercel/Netlify.
- **Environment**: Local development with `solana-test-validator`, test-ledger for testing.
- Don't ever install codama deps at anchor subfolder. When need to run Codama, use the codama installed at root folder. don't install "@codama/nodes-from-anchor` at anchor subfolder.

When assisting with code, prioritize security, correctness, and alignment with the REIT investment flow. If unsure, ask for clarification on business logic.
