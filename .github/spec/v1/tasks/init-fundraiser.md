1. Implement REIT Table in Supabase DB with the following schema: id, reit_name. Add the SQL script to migration. Call the table as `reits`.
2. Add to the UI form to require reit_name. reit_id will be randomly generated.
3. When the Init Fundraiser happens, it'll both create an entry in the DB table as well as the PDA.
