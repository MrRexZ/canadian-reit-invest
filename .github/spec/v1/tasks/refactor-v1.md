1. I want to remove the released, refunded field in `Investment` PDA and replace it with enum. It can be released, refunded, wired, share_issued (or think of a better name)  
2. Make the Investor PDA to be initialized only when user click invest (init_if_needed). Remove the Initialize Investor button and the close investor button.
3. Check if user has USDC ATA account created as part of the Invest button (if it doesn't exist), and create it if it doesn't exist yet.
